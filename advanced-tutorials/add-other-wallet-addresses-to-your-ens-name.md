# Add Other Wallet Addresses to Your ENS Name

Setting a non-Ethereum address to your name allows dApps that support ENS to use your Ethereum Name to connect to other cryptocurrency addresses. You can set up non-ETH addresses in the domain manager on [https://app.ens.domains](https://app.ens.domains).

We recommend setting multiple addresses at once to save on gas fees. Adding or removing cryptocurrencies will incur a gas fee signing request.

### How can I add a text record?

In the ENS Manager, you can add a cryptocurrency address by copying and pasting your cryptocurrency address in the corresponding address field.

If your coin type is not listed in the pre-existing fields, find the coin dropdown menu and select your currency. After pasting your address into the text field click the "Save" button.&#x20;

When you have entered all of your desired cryptocurrency, or have made changes to your other records, scroll down to the bottom of the manager page.

To permanently make these changes, you must select the "Confirm" button. This will change the on-chain data and will incur a gas fee.
