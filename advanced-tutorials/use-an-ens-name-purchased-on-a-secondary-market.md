# Use an ENS Name Purchased on a Secondary Market

After purchasing your ENS name on a secondary market like OpenSea for example,  you should next head over to the [ENS App](https://app.ens.domains). Once connecting your wallet there, you can update the records for your ENS name. You may notice only the Registrant has changed over to your wallet address. By clicking “Set” you will be able to update the Controller record. Updating ENS name records will update the state of the blockchain, so this will incur gas.\

After setting the Controller, you will be able to update the ETH Address record. Any cryptocurrency (_ERC20_) or NFTs (_ERC721_) sent to your ENS name will arrive at the Ethereum wallet address saved in that record field.

Your ENS name can also be set up to receive other tokens such as BTC, LTC, DOGE, and much more.

**Important:** Without updating these records after purchase on a secondary market, payments sent to your .eth name will not arrive to your wallet by default!
