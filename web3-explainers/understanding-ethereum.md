# Understanding Ethereum

Ethereum is a decentralized cryptocurrency blockchain that distinguishes itself by providing a Virtual Machine capable of running turing complete smart contracts, enabling technological advancements like decentralized finance and even the Ethereum Name Service itself â€” something which wasn't possible with the cryptocurrencies that preceded it.

More comprehensive information about Ethereum can be found in the [official Ethereum documentation](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/).\
