# What is a wallet?

Your wallet is effectively where your cryptocurrency is held and you interact with it, however, on a technological level, it only serves as a front-end to interact with the blockchain ledger, where your wallet—and funds—is actually stored.

Your wallet front-end only _stores_ your private key which is used to interact with the blockchain by cryptographically signing messages to make transactions from it, ensuring that even though it's on the internet, that only you have access to it.

There exists several types of cryptocurrency wallets, each with their own upsides and downsides.

Some examples are:

* **Software wallets** that you can have on your phone, on your computer or even as an extension in your browser
  * Metamask _The most popular browser extension wallet._
  * Coinbase Wallet _The non-custodial phone wallet from the largest exchange in the U.S._
* **Hardware wallets** which tries to isolate your private keys from your other devices as much as possible
