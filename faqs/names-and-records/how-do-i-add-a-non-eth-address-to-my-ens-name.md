# How do I add a non-ETH address to my ENS name?

## How to add non-ETH addresses to your ENS name&#x20;

Setting a non-Ethereum address to your name allows dApps that support ENS to use your Ethereum Name to connect to other cryptocurrency addresses. You can set up non-ETH addresses in the domain manager on https://app.ens.domains.

We recommend setting multiple addresses at once to save on gas fees.&#x20;

**Adding or removing cryptocurrencies will incur a gas fee**



## Step-by-Step

In the ENS Manager, you can add a cryptocurrency address by selecting "ADD/EDIT RECORD" and copy-pasting your cryptocurrency address in the corresponding address field.

If your coin type is not listed in the pre-existing fields, find the coin dropdown menu and select your currency. After pasting your address into the text field hit the, "save" button. \*\* Notice: You still need to confirm to permanently make these changes.\*\*

When you have entered all of your desired cryptocurrency, or have made changes to your other records, scroll down to the bottom of the manager page.



![To finalize your changes, confirm them on-chain.](<../../.gitbook/assets/learn-add-currency-stepfinal (1).png>)



To permanently make these changes, you must select the "confirm" button. This will change the on-chain data and will incur a gas fee.
