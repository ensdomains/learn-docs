# Why isn't the Resolver set to my address?

The Resolver field for an ENS name is normally set to the ENS Public Resolver contract which helps resolve your ENS name into usable records like wallet addresses, avatars, etc. This is similar to how DNS helps resolve regular domain names into usable records like IP addresses.

There are a wide variety of records that can be set and resolved depending on your use-case.&#x20;

Some examples are:

* **Wallet address records** _Contains records about your various wallet addresses, so that funds can be sent to it._
* **Avatar record** _Contains a link to an image stored as an NFT or on a website and used to visually represent your ENS name._
* **Social links** _Useful links to, for example, your GitHub, LinkedIn or Twitter-profiles._

**Important:** If you've changed the default ENS Public Resolver, you can set it back to default on the [ENS App](https://app.ens.domains). The ENS Public Resolver is:\
