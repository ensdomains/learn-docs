# What is a grace period?

The **grace period** is the 90-day timeframe that the previous registrant of an ENS name has to extend the registration on an expired name.&#x20;

During this 90-day grace period, only the registrant can extend the registration for the ENS name.

If the registrant does not renew an ENS Name, the name will enter a premium Dutch auction for 28-days. The auction currently starts at 100,000 USD and decreases over 28-days. If the name is purchased during the premium period, the purchaser will pay the premium auction price and the standard yearly fee.
