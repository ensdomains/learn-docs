# What is a grace period?

The grace period is the amount of time the previous registrant of an ENS name has to extend the registration on the name after the current registration period ends. The grace period is 90 days.

During the grace period only the registrant can extend the registration for the ENS name. No one else can register an ENS name during the grace period.

If an ENS name does not have its registration extended during the grace period by the registrant, the ENS name will drop in to a Dutch auction. The auction will start at $100,000USD and go down over 28 days until it reaches the standard registration cost. For 5 character names and above the standard registration cost is $5USD per year. For 4 character names the standard registration cost is $160USD per year. For 3 character registration names the standard registration cost is $640USD per year. During an auction, anyone can register the ENS name.\
