# How do I use an ENS name after purchasing it on a secondary marketplace?

After purchasing your ENS name on a secondary market like OpenSea or Rarible, you should next head over to the [ENS App](https://app.ens.domains). Once connecting your wallet there, you can update the records for your ENS name. You may notice that only the Registrant has changed to your wallet address. By clicking “Set,” you will update the Controller record. Updating ENS name records will update the state of the blockchain, so this will incur gas.

After setting the Controller, you can update the ETH Address record. Any cryptocurrency (ERC20) or NFTs(ERC721) sent to your ENS name will arrive at the Ethereum address saved there.

**Important:** Without updating these records after purchase on a secondary market, cryptocurrency transactions sent to your .eth name will not arrive in your wallet(s) by default.
{% endhint %}

Your ENS name can store payment addresses for more than just Ethereum. The currencies you can add, includes BTC, LTC, DOGE, and _many_ more.
