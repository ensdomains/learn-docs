# Beginner's Guide

We have created the ENS Learn Docs to complement our technical documentation with more user-focused information to ensure that you can get the most out of your ENS Name.

This information is continually evolving. We will be adding new articles, and any feedback is always appreciated.

### 2. Explainers

The explainer section provides in-depth explanations or walkthroughs that build on the topics discussed in the FAQs.

We are also providing a walkthrough of general Web3-related topics such as wallet creation, wallet security, and how to avoid scams.

### 3. Advanced Tutorials

The advanced tutorial section covers some more in-depth topics related to your ENS names.
