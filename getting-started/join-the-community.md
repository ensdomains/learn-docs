The Ethereum Name Service is a neutral, public protocol for the future of the internet and the ENS DAO is an inclusive and open community that supports the ENS protocol.

To read about our organizational Structure view our [Governance Docs](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/).

The minimum barrier of entry to our DAO is to become active in our [Discord](https://chat.ens.domains) and gain access to our[ governance forum](https://discuss.ens.domains).

To attain voting power and vote on governance proposals you must hold **$ENS** governance tokens.

To learn more about becoming involved in our community you can contact the ENS DAO [Community Working Group](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/community-working-group-dashboard/11031) which holds weekly onboarding calls every **Friday at 1:30pm EST** on [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/gvg-bkdk-xaa).
